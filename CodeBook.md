Subject:Number of volunteers participating in this experiments, there are 30 volunteers, so "Subject" varies from 1 to 30
  
Activites:There are six kinds of activites---Walkig, Walking Upstairs,Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying

The Rest Data:
	t - time domain signals
	f - frequency domain signals
	Acceleration - data comeing from accelerometer
	Gyration - data comeing from gyroscope
	XYZ - three dimention
	GravityAcceleration - gravity acceleration
	BodyAcceleration - subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration
	...Mag - magnitude of these three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm
	tBodyAccelerationJerk -  the body linear acceleration and angular velocity derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ/fBodyGyro-XYZ - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied
	
ean():Mean Value
std():Standard deviation
